										<h3><blockquote>Mission statement:</blockquote><p>
											
We understand those who are currently incarrerated have limited ability and means to directly connect with resources they need upon release and prior. The currect technology, including tablet systems and limited internet access does not allow them to search and connect them with organzations who are ready to help and this disconnect leads to the cycle of reincarceration.</p>

<p>Our mission is to help those requesting the help they need by creating a platform for organization find these individuals who are seeking their assistance. By creating free profiles, with contact information, release date information, and what services are needed, we can give these individuals the best possible plan and preparedness as they reenter society.</p>
